    <h1>Project Team #: Topic, COSI 116A F23</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Samiyanur Islam</strong>, <strong>Jaimie Louie</strong>, <strong> Kelden Dorji</strong> & <strong>Ian Ho</strong></p>
    
    <p>Project-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Housing inequality is a significant issue in the United States, affecting access to safe, affordable, and quality housing for millions of people. </em></p>
    <p><em>Expectation: Visualizing Housing Inequality in the United States (2016-2020). Our project examines housing inequality in the United States using
      data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,
      spanning the years 2016 to 2020.</em></p>

      <p>Factors contribute to the complexities of housing inequality:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Income Disparities</strong>: Significant gaps in income
          levels create unequal opportunities for individuals to access
          safe, affordable, and quality housing. Rising housing costs often
          outpace wage growth, placing a strain on low- and middle-income
          households.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location and Housing Characteristics</strong>: Housing
          markets vary considerably across different locations. Urban areas
          frequently experience higher housing costs and limited
          availability, while rural communities may face challenges with
          aging housing stock and lack of infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Demographic Factors</strong>: Race, ethnicity, age, and
          family structure can influence an individual's experience in the
          housing market. Systemic biases and discriminatory practices can
          lead to disparities in access to housing opportunities and fair
          lending practices.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Motivating Questions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the primary factors contributing to housing inequality across the U.S.?</li>
        <li>How do geographic and demographic trends impact access to housing?</li>
        <li>Can data-driven insights inform policy changes to promote equitable housing opportunities?</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Uncover Trends and Patterns</strong>: Analyze the chosen
          datasets to identify trends and patterns in housing inequality
          across different states in the U.S. from 2016 to 2020.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reveal Driving Factors</strong>: Investigate the key
          factors contributing to housing inequality, including income
          disparities, geographical variations, and demographic influences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inform Policy and Solutions</strong>: Provide insights
          that could help inform policies and interventions aimed at
          addressing housing inequality and promoting equitable access to
          safe and affordable housing for all.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>
    <p>
      Our visualizations include a choropleth map and other interactive
      elements that allow users to explore housing inequality data across
      states and demographics.
    </p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <p>
      This project uses datasets from the U.S. Department of Housing and
      Urban Development, including housing problems, demographic
      information, housing characteristics, and socioeconomic indicators
      from 2016 to 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our preprocessing steps involved data cleaning, transformation, and
      aggregation to facilitate meaningful analysis and visualization.
    </p>


    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
