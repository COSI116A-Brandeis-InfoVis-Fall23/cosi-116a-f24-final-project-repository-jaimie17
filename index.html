    <p><strong>Samiyanur Islam</strong>, <strong>Jaimie Louie</strong>, <strong> Kelden Dorji</strong> & <strong>Ian Ho</strong></p>
    
    <p>Semester-long Course Project as part of COSI 116A: Information Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/~dylan/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://cs.brandeis.edu/">Brandeis University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Housing inequality is a significant issue in the United States, affecting access to safe, affordable, and quality housing for millions of people. </em></p>
    <p><em>Visualizing Housing Inequality in the United States (2016-2020): Our project examines housing inequality in the United States using
      data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,
      spanning the years 2016 to 2020.</em></p>

      <p>Factors that contribute to the complexities of housing inequality:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Income Disparities</strong>: Significant gaps in income
          levels create unequal opportunities for individuals to access
          safe and affordable housing. Rising housing costs often
          outpace wage growth, placing a strain on low- and middle-income
          households.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Location and Housing Characteristics</strong>: Housing
          markets vary considerably across different locations. Urban areas
          frequently experience higher housing costs and limited
          availability, while rural communities may face challenges with
          aging housing stock and lack of infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Demographic Factors</strong>: Race, ethnicity, age, and
          household structure can influence an individual's experience in the
          housing market. Systemic biases and discriminatory practices can
          lead to disparities in access to housing opportunities and fair
          lending practices.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Motivating Questions:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>What are the primary factors contributing to housing inequality across the U.S.?</li>
        <li>How do geographic and demographic trends impact access to housing?</li>
        <li>Can data-driven insights inform policy changes to promote equitable housing opportunities?</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Uncover Trends and Patterns</strong>: Analyze the chosen
          datasets to identify trends and patterns in housing inequality
          across different states in the U.S. from 2016 to 2020.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reveal Driving Factors</strong>: Investigate the key
          factors contributing to housing inequality, including income
          disparities, geographical variations, and demographic influences.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inform Policy and Solutions</strong>: Provide insights
          that could help inform policies and interventions aimed at
          addressing housing inequality and promoting equitable access to
          safe and affordable housing.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>
    <p>
      Our visualizations include a choropleth U.S. map and other interactive
      elements that allow users to explore housing inequality data across
      states. The map is color coded to represent the percentage of housing problems in each state, 
      with housing problems defined as households with any of the following issues:
      <ol>
        <li>Housing unit lacks complete kitchen facilities</li>
        <li>Housing unit lacks complete plumbing facilities</li>
        <li>Household is overcrowded (HUD defines overcrowding as more than 1 person per room)</li>
        <li>Household is cost burdened (HUD defines cost burden as monthly housing costs (including utilities) exceeding 30% of monthly income)</li>
      </ol>
      Our visualization also includes a pie chart displaying racial demographics and a bar chart showing income distribution for each state.
      Selecting a state from the dropdown menu will update the map and charts to display data for that state.
    </p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <p>
      This project uses datasets from the U.S. Department of Housing and
      Urban Development, including <a href="https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/35f3c8985bc7407ba0fe8f7b2291f5c0/about">housing problems</a>, 
      <a href="https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/709f3ace71c24b29aa0f90e2f16c114d/about">demographic
        information</a>, <a href="https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/c77a9808624943b1a4b4b63007b0efcc/about">housing characteristics</a>, 
        and <a href="https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/7d6504755b604e02afea342ac9cf748f/about">socioeconomic indicators</a>
      by state from 2016 to 2020.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our preprocessing steps involved data cleaning, transformation, and
      aggregation to facilitate meaningful analysis and visualization.
      First, we downloaded the datasets as Excel files from the HUD website and imported them into Google Sheets.
      We then cleaned the data by adding the appropriate column headers found on the website and removing empty columns and columns unrelated to our topic.
      Once we had our cleaned data, we explored it in Tableau to identify preliminary trends and patterns. 
      We further reduced the data to include only the columns we needed for our visualizations, including percent housing problems (housing problem dataset), percent household income brackets (socioeconomic dataset), and percent racial demographics (race dataset) in separate sheets.
      Finally, we exported the data as CSV files, then converted them to JSON files for use in our visualizations.
    </p>


    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p>Our domain tasks broken down into abstract tasks were:
      <ol>
        <li>What factors contribute the most to housing inequality? (summarize, explore, present)</li>
        <li>Do factors (such as race, income, etc.) affect housing inequality? (identify, locate, discover)</li>
        <li>Which locations are most affected by housing disparity? (compare, locate, discover)</li>
        <li>What trends can we find in the data? (summarize, explore, present)</li>
      </ol>
      Our visualization is primarily developed for “discover” and “present” consumptions. 
      We would say discover because we are focusing on housing inequality, and want to be able to show our audience 
      a visualization that will let them explore the data and form some discovery about the importance of the topic. 
      In order to do this, we used interactive visualizations that show factors related to housing inequality, 
      like location, income, and demographics. Secondly, it is developed for “present” because we want to tell a story with our visualization,
      which can help with highlighting the disparities surrounding this issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The primary consumers of our visualization would be the general public, policymakers, possibly teachers, and researchers.
      This is because we could use our visualization as a source of raising awareness about housing inequality through the public, 
      and it could reach policymakers into realizing the severity and passing reforms to tackle the issue. 
      Researchers and teachers could also possibly play a similar role in being able to influence a new generation of students and scholars to help this issue.
    </p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>


    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>Short summary of work completed and areas for improvement/future-work.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: Meaningfully wraps up project and has good future directions.</em></p>
